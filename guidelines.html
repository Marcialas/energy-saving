            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i>  How electricity is measured?  <i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i></h2>
            <p>Electricity use is measured in units known as kilo watt hours (kWh) and there are 1,000 watts in a kilo
                watt. </p>
            <p>So one kilowatt hour is the amount of energy you'd use if you kept a 1 kilo watt/1,000 watt appliance
                running for one hour.</p>
            <p> Electricity meters record each household's consumption and are read by ESB Networks to determine exactly
                how much your bill will be.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-euro-sign"></i>  Which appliances cost the most to run?  <i class="fa-solid fa-euro-sign"></i></h2>
            <p>So, how can you keep your consumption and bills, as low as possible?

                Step one is knowing which appliances use the most electricity. Step two is being smart about when and
                how often you use them.

                When you buy any appliance, its handbook will tell you how much energy it uses. The higher the kWh, the
                more it uses. So for example a 3 kWh appliance will use three times as much energy for every hour of
                usage as a 1 kWh device and five times as much energy as a 600 watt (0.6 kWh) device.

                A good rule of thumb is: if it makes things hot, particularly in a short space of time, it costs a lot.
                Think kettles, hair dryers, tumble dryers and electric showers, they all have a ferocious appetite for
                electricity.

                So let's look at what running a few appliances over the course of a day could cost you.

                Note - your actual costs will depend on the energy efficiency of the appliance you use. Most modern
                appliances (particularly washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and TVs) are way more efficient
                than older models, but the rating will help you choose the most efficient model. The ratings, which are
                compulsory, range from A to G, with A being the most efficient.

                Also, if you have a Night Saver meter or a new smart meter installed, you may be able to avail of much
                cheaper electricity by switching your energy use to a different time of the day.</p>
