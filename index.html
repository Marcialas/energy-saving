            <p id="grant">One of the ways to save in the long term, is to retrofit your home, but it involves major
                investment, we
                are talking tens of thousands euro to fully retrofit a home.
                If you have cash to spare, it might be a good idea to invest in your family home, luckily enough
                government has a variety of grants available to help you cover the costs. <br> <em>But bear in mind that
                    you
                    have to pay in full to contractor and then apply for the grant.</em><br>
                More information on grants available can be found <a

            <h3>Drought-proofing</h3>
            <p>This is at the top of the list for a reason, especially in older homes with old windows and doors.
                Poorly drought-proofed home will waste a lot of energy trying to heat up a home, during cold and windy
                season.
                Cheapest option is to DIY jobs, just by buying and installing window drought stopper seals around all
                windows, you will make your home more energy efficient.
            </p>
            <p>Open chimney is a major source of heat loss, that should be plugged securely if not in use. This alone
                would save you approx. €60 per year in heating bills.</p>
            <p>Something as simple as closing doors of rooms reduces drought through out the house.</p>

            <h3>Temperature, timers and controls</h3>
            <p> Set the times that your heating comes on and off so that it fits with your daily routine. Radiators will
                continue to heat your home for some time after the heating is turned off. So try this, turn on your
                heating 30 minutes before you need it and turn it off 30 minutes before you don't need it anymore.
                Smart thermostats comes in handy when you can just control your heating from your phone and there's even
                a €700 grant available from government grants mentioned <a href="#grant">here</a></p>
            <p>Turning down your thermostat and putting a jumper on instead of walking with a t-shirt in the middle of
                winter will also fill your wallet with saved money from heating bills. On average turning down
                thermostat by 1°C could save you close to 10% on heating</p>
