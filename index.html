        <h3>Drought-proofing</h3>
        <p>This is at the top of the list for a reason, especially in older homes with old windows and doors. 
            Poorly drought-proofed home will waste a lot of energy trying to heat up a home, during cold and windy season. 
            Cheapest option is to DIY jobs, just by buying and installing window drought stopper seals around all windows, you will make your home more energy efficient.
        </p>
        <p>Open chimney is a major source of heat loss, that should be plugged securely if not in use. This alone would save you approx. â‚¬60 per year in heating bills.</p>
        <p>Something as simple as closing doors of rooms reduces drought through out the house.</p>
