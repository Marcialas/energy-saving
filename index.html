                        major
                        investment, we

                        government has a variety of grants available to help you cover the costs. <br> <em>But bear in

                <h2>Drought-proofing</h3>
                    <p>This is at the top of the list for a reason, especially in older homes with old windows and
                        doors.
                        Poorly drought-proofed home will waste a lot of energy trying to heat up a home, during cold and
                        windy
                        season.
                        Cheapest option is to DIY jobs, just by buying and installing window drought stopper seals
                        around
                        all
                        windows, you will make your home more energy efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>Open chimney is a major source of heat loss, that should be plugged securely if not in use. This
                        alone
                        would save you approx. €60 per year in heating bills.</p>
                    <p>Something as simple as closing doors of rooms reduces drought through out the house.</p>

                <h2>Smart use of home appliances</h3>
                    <p>Some appliances are very heavy on electricity consumption and their usage should not be wasted,
                        have
                        some
                        of the highest consumption appliances examples below. Also to put it in perspective, jump to our
                        page
                        that
                        shows just how much energy and money appliances consume <a href="guidelines.html">here</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thumble dryers are <strong><em>very</em></strong> electricity hungry machines, so try to
                            avoid using it on
                            warm
                            and
                            dry days and wire hang your clothes outside.
                        </li>
                        <li>Washing machines are also heavy on energy, mainly to heat the water, so washing your less
                            dirty
                            clothes in lower Temperature programs will help you reduce your bill.</li>
                        <li>Dishwasher, same as washing machine, uses most of energy to heat the water, so setting it to
                            lower
                            Temperature and turning it on only when it's full will save you money.</li>
                        <li>Kettle is another energy heavy appliance, so you should try to only boil the water you need
                            at
                            that
                            time and avoid boiling full kettle just for 1 cup of tea.</li>

                <h2>Temperature, timers and controls</h3>
                    <p> Set the times that your heating comes on and off so that it fits with your daily routine.
                        Radiators
                        will
                        continue to heat your home for some time after the heating is turned off. So try this, turn on
                        your
                        heating 30 minutes before you need it and turn it off 30 minutes before you don't need it
                        anymore.
                        Smart thermostats comes in handy when you can just control your heating from your phone and
                        there's
                        even
                        a €700 grant available from government grants mentioned at the beginning <a
                            href="#grant">here</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>Turning down your thermostat and putting a jumper on instead of walking with a t-shirt in the
                        middle
                        of
                        winter will also fill your wallet with saved money from heating bills. On average turning down
                        thermostat by 1°C could save you close to 10% on heating</p>
                    <p>Remember when your dad used to give out for leaving the lights on when you were a kid? Yeah,
                        forgeting to
                        turn them off when you leave the room can build up in costs, especially if you use old type of
                        lights.
                        Which is a great investment to upgrade all light bulbs to more efficient ones like LED type.
