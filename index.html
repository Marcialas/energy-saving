                    Bord Gais will help you understand it in detail. Most utility providers bills has same structure, so
                    know one, know them all.
                </p>
                <p id="grant">One of the ways to save in the long term, is to retrofit your home, but it involves major
                    investment, we
                    are talking tens of thousands euro to fully retrofit a home.
                    If you have cash to spare, it might be a good idea to invest in your family home, luckily enough
                    government has a variety of grants available to help you cover the costs. <br> <em>But bear in mind
                        that
                        you
                        have to pay in full to contractor and then apply for the grant.</em><br>
                    More information on grants available can be found <a

            <h2>Drought-proofing</h3>
                <p>This is at the top of the list for a reason, especially in older homes with old windows and doors.
                    Poorly drought-proofed home will waste a lot of energy trying to heat up a home, during cold and
                    windy
                    season.
                    Cheapest option is to DIY jobs, just by buying and installing window drought stopper seals around
                    all
                    windows, you will make your home more energy efficient.
                </p>
                <p>Open chimney is a major source of heat loss, that should be plugged securely if not in use. This
                    alone
                    would save you approx. €60 per year in heating bills.</p>
                <p>Something as simple as closing doors of rooms reduces drought through out the house.</p>

            <h2>Smart use of home appliances</h3>
                <p>Some appliances are very heavy on electricity consumption and their usage should not be wasted, have
                    some
                    of the highest consumption appliances examples below. Also to put it in perspective, jump to our
                    page
                    that
                    shows just how much energy and money appliances consume <a href="#table.html">here</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thumble dryers are <em>very</em> electricity hungry machines, so try to avoid using it on warm
                        and
                        dry days and wire hang your clothes outside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Washing machines are also heavy on energy, mainly to heat the water, so washing your less dirty
                        clothes in lower Temperature programs will help you reduce your bill.</li>
                    <li>Dishwasher, same as washing machine, uses most of energy to heat the water, so setting it to
                        lower
                        Temperature and turning it on only when it's full will save you money.</li>
                    <li>Kettle is another energy heavy appliance, so you should try to only boil the water you need at
                        that
                        time and avoid boiling full kettle just for 1 cup of tea.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Temperature, timers and controls</h3>
                <p> Set the times that your heating comes on and off so that it fits with your daily routine. Radiators
                    will
                    continue to heat your home for some time after the heating is turned off. So try this, turn on your
                    heating 30 minutes before you need it and turn it off 30 minutes before you don't need it anymore.
                    Smart thermostats comes in handy when you can just control your heating from your phone and there's
                    even
                    a €700 grant available from government grants mentioned at the beginning <a href="#grant">here</a>
                </p>
                <p>Turning down your thermostat and putting a jumper on instead of walking with a t-shirt in the middle
                    of
                    winter will also fill your wallet with saved money from heating bills. On average turning down
                    thermostat by 1°C could save you close to 10% on heating</p>
                <p>Remember when your dad used to give out for leaving the lights on when you were a kid? Yeah,
                    forgeting to
                    turn them off when you leave the room can build up in costs, especially if you use old type of
                    lights.
                    Which is a great investment to upgrade all light bulbs to more efficient ones like LED type.
